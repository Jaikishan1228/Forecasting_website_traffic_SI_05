Forecasting Website Traffic
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast website traffic (such as daily visitors, page views, or sessions) using time series analysis and machine learning models. By leveraging historical traffic data, the notebook demonstrates methods to predict future traffic trends, which can be useful for marketing campaigns, server load planning, and performance optimization.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of website traffic logs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations of trends and seasonality.

Time series forecasting using models such as:

ARIMA / SARIMA

Prophet

Machine learning regression models

Model evaluation with metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE.

Visualization of predicted vs actual website traffic.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

Statsmodels / Prophet – Time series forecasting

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
